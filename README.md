# Machine Learning Tutorials with Scikit-Learn

This project is a collection of tutorials and demonstrations showcasing the use of the **scikit-learn** library in Python. It covers a wide range of machine learning concepts, from data preparation to supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Each tutorial includes code examples, explanations, and hands-on exercises to facilitate learning.

## Topics Covered

### Data Preparation
- **Data Formatting**: Preparing data for use with scikit-learn (`02_02_How_to_Format_Data.ipynb`).

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression**: Basics of linear regression (`02_03_Linear_Regression.ipynb`).
- **Train/Test Splitting**: Splitting data for model evaluation (`02_04_Train_Test_Split.ipynb`).
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary and multiclass classification (`02_05_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`, `02_06_Logistic_Regression_for_Multiclass.ipynb`).
- **Decision Trees**: Building and visualizing decision trees (`02_07_Decision_Trees.ipynb`, `02_08_How_to_Visualize_Decision_Trees.ipynb`).
- **Ensemble Methods**: Bagged trees (`02_09_Bagged_Trees.ipynb`) and random forests (`02_10_Random_Forests.ipynb`).

### Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping data using K-Means (`03_02_KMeans.ipynb`).
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction for visualization (`03_03_PCA_for_Data_Visualization.ipynb`) and speeding up machine learning algorithms (`03_04_PCA_to_Speed_Up_Machine_Learning.ipynb`).

### Workflow Optimization
- **Pipelines**: Streamlining machine learning workflows (`03_05_Pipelines.ipynb`).

## Datasets Used
- **Iris Dataset**: For classification tasks.
- **Modified MNIST Dataset**: For multiclass classification.
- **King County House Sales Dataset**: For regression tasks (`data/kc_house_data.csv`).
